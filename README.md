# Personal-Assistant-using-python
In this project, the implemented assistant can open up the application(if it's installed in the system), search
Google, Wikipedia and youtube about the query, calculate any mathematical question, etc by just giving
the voice command. We can process the data as per the need or can add the functionality, depends upon
how we code things.
